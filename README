HOMEWORK 1: Desperate moments

In this homework we play with memory. We use data_structure as a "wrapper"
for different so-called "dedications". 
In data_structure we initially keep the type, the len and the specifications
 of the "dedication" 

The main "catch" of this project is that we store the data in a generic array,
without storing any pointers, only data.

We implement a set of commands to play with:
    insert - insert a new "dedication" on the last position
    insert at - insert a new "dedication" on an indicated position
    delete at - delete an indicated "dedication"
    find - find an indicated "dedication"
    print - show all the "dedications"
    exit - end program, free memory

The most difficult aspect was, at first, figuring out how to
traverse the array, since each element had a different size.
After solving this issue, half of the problem was already dealt with.

Besides this, the only challenging part left to do was figuring out
the distance and the size with which to use memmove() function.

I believe that after solving this project, I improved upon my usage
of pointers and memory manipulation.
